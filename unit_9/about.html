		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Caitlin. I am a 23 year old single mother to my son beautiful son Clark. My hobbies include hooping, cooking, and spending time with my family. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and I've learned to cope with it through cooking and exercise. Anxiety is common mental illness amongst many men and women through my age. I created this site in hopes to find comfort through healthy hobbies.</p>
